# Nxn Matrix Solver
Version 1 of Nxn Matrix Solver was supposed to be a simple implementation of Cramer's rule for a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix but I created a 2nd version which should solve Nxn dimensional matrices that aren't ridiculously large. Input must be encapsalated with brackets. This is meant to solve a system of equations.Input is in the form: [[Matrix A]], [[Matrix B]].For more information feel free to look up augmented/coeffecient matrix for a better understanding.
#### Ex in code:
[[1,2,1,-1],[3,2,4,4],[4,4,3,4],[2,0,1,5]],[[5,16,22,15]]
#### Ex in math:
a + 2b + c - d = 5  
3a + 2b + 4c + 4d = 16  
4a + 4b + 3c + 4d = 22  
2a + c + 5d = 15
